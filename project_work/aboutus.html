    <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br>
    <p>Biryani came to India from the Iranian lands, and stayed here to become a part of our cuisine since then.
         In 15 th Century AD India, Biryani was a quick wholesome meal easy for troops on the move. 
         In 21 st Century AD, it is a symbol of salvation for food connoisseurs so much so that one can never 
         hold their urge to dig in to a warm steaming Handi of Biryani.<br><br>
         We at SS Biryani believe that “Biryani” will be the biggest Food Services & Delivery
         category from India. Biryani is a complete meal, filled with aromas & flavours, recipes can be both
        authentic & versatile, and it caters itself to delivery very well. SS uses the best ingredients 
        including one of the most expensive branded rice specially aged around 2 years, spices handpicked 
        from TamilNadu, and most stringently selected meats & vegetables for its Biryanis & Kebabs. 
        Apart from this, SS uses world class technologies, processes & systems to give the best quality, 
        standardization, hygiene & convenience to customers and the ability to order online or through call

        individual earthen Handis with the freshest ingredients. Also the Kolkata Biryani which is a sub 
        variant of Lucknowi Biryani. SS is the only Biryani Chain to make Biryani fresh for every individual 
        order, and deliver it in the Handi in which it was cooked. To take your Biryani experience a notch 
        higher, we send you earthen Angeethis (Aanch) with each order to give the last bit of dum for the 
        perfect smoky flavour and aroma of spices when you dig in to your Biryani. For the Galouti Kebabs, 
        SS minces the meat multiple times, and marinates them in the most authentic way, to make them surely

        heart.SS prefer to pre-book the orders or they will deliver in 90 mins, as each Biryani order is cooked

        <h3>BIRYANI</h3><br>
        <p>Biryani is prepared in an earthen pot called Handi, the rice and meat are layered, 
            bottom and top layer are always rice. An interlayer of some condiments is introduced 
            between the meat and the rice.<br><br> Hyderabadi Biryani is the kachay gosht ki Biryani or the dum 
            Biryani, where the meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice.<br><br> Lucknowni or Malabar Biryani is a pakki Biryani.
             The rice and meat are generally partially cooked separately in spiced water, then layered and 
             cooked by the dum pukht method.<br><br> It is a sub variant of Lucknowi style of Biryani.SS uses one of the

         <h3>KURMA</h3><br>
         <p>Korma is a noble dish that once graced the banquet tables of the imperial Mughal court, 
             rich with cream and nuts and heavily scented with expensive spice, has become one of the most 
             loved dishes in the world.<br><br>
             At SS, The Korma is made by marinating the main ingredients in yoghurt, cashew paste and 
             fresh ground spices to produce a mouth-watering thick sauce or glaze. We believe that SS serves 
             the best mutton, chicken & veg kormas in the country.</p>

        <h3>GRILL CHICKEN</h3><br>
        <p>Grilled chicken is so versatile that most cultures have some variation of the dish: Mexico's pollo asado,
             Indonesia's chicken satay, Caribbean jerk chicken, American barbecue — the list goes on and on. <br><br>These 
             dishes each have distinct flavors, but they all start with perfectly cooked poultry: moist, tender, 
             and juicy with a lovely golden brown crispy skin kissed by a few lines of grill marks.
